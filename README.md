This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## How to use/examine
    This app is hosted at the url: https://candid-sunflower-2e1cee.netlify.app/
    
    Regarding usage, you can search for a search term on the home page to navigate to products page or you can manually append '/products' to root url to navigate

    Currently the app has static products' data and no backend (I intend to create backend in near future). The app asynchronously draws static product data from a front end file to imitate a real world web app.

    The app intends to demonstrate working knowledge of front end web developement. I have used React, Next, Redux, TypeScript, formik, MUI, styled components, scss, css in order to build the app.

    The project is flexible in terms of its usage of different styling methods. For example, it uses css, scss (basic and moduled), MUI and styled components. This is done to practice using varities of styling which can't be done on big scale production app. I have used both redux and react context api for the same reason.

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.js`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.
